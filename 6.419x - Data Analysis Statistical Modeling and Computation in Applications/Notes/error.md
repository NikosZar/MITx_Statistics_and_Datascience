# Type I and Type II Errors: A Delicate Balance

## Definitions

### Type I Error (α)
- Rejecting a true null hypothesis ("false positive")
- The significance level α represents the probability of making a Type I error
- Conventionally set at 0.05 or 0.01 in research
- The significance level is actually just the Type I error. Setting the significance level to $\alpha$ is equivalent to allowing Type I error to occur.

### Type II Error (β)
- Failing to reject a false null hypothesis ("false negative")
- β represents the probability of making a Type II error
- Related to statistical power (1 - β)

## The Inverse Relationship

There is a fundamental trade-off between Type I and Type II errors:

- Decreasing α (reducing false positives) increases β (more false negatives)
- Decreasing β (increasing power) increases α (more false positives)

This relationship means we cannot minimize both types of errors simultaneously. We must carefully balance them based on:

- Research context
- Relative costs of each error type
- Sample size constraints
- Effect size of interest

## Practical Implications

When designing studies, researchers must:
1. Set α based on field conventions and consequences of false positives
2. Ensure adequate power (1 - β) through appropriate sample size
3. Consider the practical significance of the effect size
4. Account for multiple comparisons if applicable

The goal is to find an optimal balance that minimizes the most costly type of error while maintaining reasonable control over the other.

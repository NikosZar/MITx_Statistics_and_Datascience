1) understand the fittin-error function (the sum of all the squared residuals)
2) For above, the unkown parameters can be found by solving the optimization problem minE(beta_0, beta_1). Review optimization problems. function above is apparently quadratic.
3) understand why the slope of the linear model is governed by the correlation coefficient.
